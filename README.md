# Perceptionallity

Perceptionallity is simply the result of my desire to share the thoughts and stories in my mind through programming.</br>
Consider this GitHub page as a diary documenting my **trial** of translating my thoughts into the last corner of the internet in the form of a story game, ensuring they're preserved online where they'll never be lost.

## How to run
Currently there is no compiled executable so you need to compile it yourself. Only Lombok as dependency is needed.

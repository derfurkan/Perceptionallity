# Perceptionallity

Perceptionallity is simply the result of my desire to share the thoughts and stories in my mind through my love for programming.</br>
I'll continue working on this project for as long as I feel inspired to do so, even if it never reaches completion. Consider this GitHub page as a diary documenting my journey of translating my thoughts into the last corner of the internet in the form of a story game, ensuring they're preserved online where they'll never be lost.

## How to run
Currently there is no compiled executable so you need to compile it yourself. Only Lombok as dependency is needed.

## Why Java?
It's the language I know inside out and have been working with for a long time. I might dabble in other languages along the way, but for now, Java is the main game plan.
